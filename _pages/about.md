## Overview ##

Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are currently receiving widespread
attention from not only the computer vision and machine learning communities,
but also in the MIC and CAI community.
These models combine the advanced deep neural networks with classical
density estimation (either explicit or implicit) for achieving state-of-the-art
results.
