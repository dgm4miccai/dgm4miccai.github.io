## Overview ##

Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are currently receiving widespread
attention from not only the computer vision and machine learning communities,
but also in the MIC and CAI community.
These models combine the advanced deep neural networks with classical
density estimation (either explicit or implicit) for achieving state-of-the-art
results.

We seek contributions that include, but are not limited to:
- Novel architectures, loss functions, and theoretical developments for Generative Adversarial Networks, Adversarial Learning, Variational Auto-Encoder, Disentanglement, Flow, Autoregressive models
- Multi-Modality and Cross-Modality linking
- Novel metrics and uncertainty estimates for performance assessment and interpretability of generative models
- Generative models under limited, sparse and noisy image inputs
- Supervised and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Transfer Learning and Multi-Task Learning
- Segmentation, Detection, Synthesis, Reconstruction, Denoising, Supersampling, Registration
- Image-to-Image translation for Synthetic Training Data Generation or Augmented Reality

We particularly welcome papers driven by the theme "MIC meets CAI".
Interesting novel applications of deep generative models in MIC and CAI beyond these topics are also welcome.

Workshop proceedings are published as Springer Nature's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
