## Overview ##

Deep generative models such as Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are currently receiving widespread
attention from not only the computer vision and machine learning communities,
but also in the MIC and CAI community.
These models combine the advanced deep neural networks with classical
density estimation (either explicit or implicit) for achieving state-of-the-art
results.

Using GANs for sample synthesis could potentially be used to address the
shortage of large and diverse annotated databases.
In addition, the concept of two networks that are optimized in an adversarial
game has been exploited to provide an additional loss term to improve
performance of existing image analysis methods.
Adversarial methods have been successfully exploited in typical medical
image analysis applications such as denoising, reconstruction, segmentation,
and detection.
Moreover, adversarial training has led to new applications in paradigms
such as semi-supervised learning and abnormality detection.

While GAN is the most popular among the deep generative models, explicit
density modeling by VAE has seen a recent surge of latent space disentanglement
in medical imaging literature.
VAEs can also be exploited successfully for semi-supervised learning.

Apart from that, interesting novel applications of GANs in the CAI community
were published in the last two years at MICCAI, e.g. for increasing
the realism in surgical training, for providing additional ground truth in
endoscopy and the opportunity for benchmarking based on virtual environments.
Of all the accepted papers in MICCAI 2019, almost 50+ papers were based on
some form of generative modeling.
MICCAI 2020 main conference had two dedicated sessions on GAN.
We can expect a rise in the submitted papers on generative modeling to
MICCAI 2021.

While the conference will not be able to accept a significant number of these
papers in the main track, the authors of close to threshold papers can still
incorporate the suggestions from the reviewers and submit in our workshop.
With the rise of deep generative models for both Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention, we believe our workshop and the associated
[AdaptOR challenge](https://adaptor2021.github.io/) will be instrumental to
develop a sub-community within MICCAI for focused discussion on generative
modeling in both MIC and CAI.
